# SPR X-Ray Gender Prediction Challenge

This repository contains my work for the **SPR X-Ray Gender Prediction Kaggle Challenge**, completed during the [**2023 Bumblekite Machine Learning Summer School in Health, Care, and Biosciences**](https://www.bumblekite.co/summer-school-23) at **ETH Zurich**.

The challenge was presented by [**Dr. Judy Gichoya (Emory University)**](https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/gichoya-judy.php), keynote lecturer at the summer school, as part of her tutorial. She provided participants with three tasks based on their experience level: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. The **SPR X-Ray Gender Prediction Kaggle Challenge** was the **advanced task**, focused on predicting the gender of patients from chest X-ray images.

This was my first experience working with medical imaging data and training models on a Mac M1 GPU using PyTorch. Despite computational limitations, I successfully developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and achieved an accuracy of **0.89**.

## üß† Learnings

This project was a valuable introduction to medical imaging and resource-aware deep learning workflows. I gained experience in:

- Preprocessing and normalizing imaging datasets  
- Building and debugging CNN architectures  
- Learning to leverage Apple's M1 GPU with PyTorch.
- Troubleshooting environment and compatibility issues  
- Tuning hyperparameters and interpreting performance metrics
